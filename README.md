# facebook-bot
bot that retrieves your friends birthdays

**Caution** my account got banned by facebook for running this so please do not run on your own personal account.

If you do want to run it (at your own risk) you'll need:
 - selenium - https://pypi.org/project/selenium/ - install into python scripts 
 - chrome
 - chrome driver (same version as your chrome download)

Change YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS into the email you want to use and YOUR PASSWORD into the password for that account.

Note this only works for the new facebook layout, not the old one.
